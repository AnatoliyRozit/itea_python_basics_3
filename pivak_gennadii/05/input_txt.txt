Cryptocurrency exchanges hold users XRP in the same wallet address, which is separated into various sub-wallets. To differentiate between the different holdings, sub-wallets use 32-bit source and destination tags to identify a transaction recipient.
At present, tags are publicly viewable and, if used frequently, can be associated with a particular user. Some exchanges already generate new tags for every transaction, but there are only a finite number of tags available. Although this isn't an immediate issue, there comes a point where exchanges will be unable to generate any new tags.
Bougalis proposal would also mean users could toggle blinded tags on or off. They would work as a single function so the network does not become overburdened.
Using blinded tags not only protects users identity, but it also acts as an effective "workaround" for preserving the number of destination and source tags available to exchanges, Bougalis added. As blinded tags leverage an existing tag infrastructure on exchanges, it is uncertain whether users sending XRP between standalone wallets would be able to do so privately.
